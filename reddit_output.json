    "body": "I'm a pretty moderate guy in life but if you have a heart, a soul you cannot deny the immense purposeful cruelty of MAGA and Donald \"I'm not in the Epstein files\" Trump. I don't care who you are or where you come from, what god you subscribe to or what side of the aisle you align with, this man and his cohort of supplicant dogs are destroying this country.\n\nJust 2 weeks ago I nearly got detained by ICE for trying to stop these animals from arresting a family off Broadacres Marketplace in Vegas. Literally smashed 3 of their windows, dragged two parents out of their car, knees on backs while their two young kids were crying in the car glass all over these kids too. These guys nearly jumped me as I was trying to get their names and information, one straight up said to me \"you come close and you're next\" I couldn't tell they were Latino, European or any other immigrant background in all honesty at all they just looked like average white people maybe half a shade more tanned it's Vegas we regularly have 100 degree summers tanning people naturally and I'm pretty sure these guys didn't care the man they detained kept saying he was a citizen they just didn't care. Luckily my twin brother called Vegas PD before dragging me a safe distance away because in that moment I wanted to lay these guys out which woulda landed me in Nigeria for all we know and for once I was glad the police showed up de-escalated the situation. That family got to walk free because we called the POLICE but no doubt they are traumatised by this shit who wouldn't be in that situation? Is there any news coverage any 6 o'clock news story on this no, If I was them I would leave the country after something like that no way you would feel safe sending your kids to schools where they can get shot at and pick them up only to be fucking detained by ICE. There are probably hundreds of thousands stories like this happening right now and that worries me. How long can this go on for, how long is it gonna be until they just take Americans off the street because they don't care if you are a migrant or not. I didn't need to have the IRL experience to tell you that this current environment is simply unsustainable because there are no guard rails, no due process, no accountability. Why do ICE wear these masks? they know what they are doing is fucking illegal and don't want to be recognised for their actions because that would mean actual consequences. How long is it gonna be until you aren't \"American\" enough and get detained for it?\n\nAnd the kicker is Obama deported tons of people, way more than Trump in his first term I and many others won't debate that fact but he didn't send paid masked up goons with the authority of the President and more job security than a civil servant into minority neighborhoods to literally de-humanise and assault people in front of their kids as they send them to god knows where and call that shit righteous or justice. We still don't know where the hundreds of missing people who got sent to \"Alligator Alcatraz\" went and nobody gives a shit.\n\nI've seen the impact of this government's god awful actions here at home, Vegas is dead, in 10 months tourism is gone these once bustling strips are empty, nobody wants to come here to the US let alone Vegas, nobody can afford to go out here or even wants to risk being caught up in this shitstorm here anymore. I work in finance I will tell you for free we are gonna be in a recession by the years end, no amount of tariff revenue can cover the gigantic holes in our economy being held up by the few US tech companies run by tech oligarchs right now profiting off the AI bubble before it bursts. Right now Nvidia has $4.6 trillion market cap, our entire pharmaceutical industry has a combined market cap of $4.2 trillion. If Nvidia has a bad day on the markets it now literally impacts the entire US economy.\n\nWhen it comes to trade relations just give up Trump has alienated and threatened our own allies with his dumbass policy, yes start a trade war with China lets see how that will go for us when we haven't had a robust manufacturing industry for the last 50 years because we outsource everything. It will just get to a point where the rest of the world will just turn their back on America because who would genuinely want work with us after all that has happened now? Just look at the Hyundai plant raid in Georgia that happened in September, 1 dumb woman named Tori Branum who mind you was running for Georgia's 12th congressional district gave a tip to ICE about foreigners who were Korean nationals trying to train workers and get the Hyundai, 475 South Korean workers all here legally got detained by ICE. Now these guys got released eventually but all these workers all but 1 decided to leave and never return so we have a Hyundai Plant in Georgia that cost upwards of $7 billion to even build is now empty with no one to train AMERICAN workers for the job let alone actually work. South Korea is one of the largest foreign investors in the US and we have now given them no reason to trust us, same with China, India and others.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a pretty moderate guy in life but if you have a heart, a soul you cannot deny the immense purposeful cruelty of MAGA and Donald &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not in the Epstein files&amp;quot; Trump. I don&amp;#39;t care who you are or where you come from, what god you subscribe to or what side of the aisle you align with, this man and his cohort of supplicant dogs are destroying this country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just 2 weeks ago I nearly got detained by ICE for trying to stop these animals from arresting a family off Broadacres Marketplace in Vegas. Literally smashed 3 of their windows, dragged two parents out of their car, knees on backs while their two young kids were crying in the car glass all over these kids too. These guys nearly jumped me as I was trying to get their names and information, one straight up said to me &amp;quot;you come close and you&amp;#39;re next&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t tell they were Latino, European or any other immigrant background in all honesty at all they just looked like average white people maybe half a shade more tanned it&amp;#39;s Vegas we regularly have 100 degree summers tanning people naturally and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure these guys didn&amp;#39;t care the man they detained kept saying he was a citizen they just didn&amp;#39;t care. Luckily my twin brother called Vegas PD before dragging me a safe distance away because in that moment I wanted to lay these guys out which woulda landed me in Nigeria for all we know and for once I was glad the police showed up de-escalated the situation. That family got to walk free because we called the POLICE but no doubt they are traumatised by this shit who wouldn&amp;#39;t be in that situation? Is there any news coverage any 6 o&amp;#39;clock news story on this no, If I was them I would leave the country after something like that no way you would feel safe sending your kids to schools where they can get shot at and pick them up only to be fucking detained by ICE. There are probably hundreds of thousands stories like this happening right now and that worries me. How long can this go on for, how long is it gonna be until they just take Americans off the street because they don&amp;#39;t care if you are a migrant or not. I didn&amp;#39;t need to have the IRL experience to tell you that this current environment is simply unsustainable because there are no guard rails, no due process, no accountability. Why do ICE wear these masks? they know what they are doing is fucking illegal and don&amp;#39;t want to be recognised for their actions because that would mean actual consequences. How long is it gonna be until you aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;American&amp;quot; enough and get detained for it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the kicker is Obama deported tons of people, way more than Trump in his first term I and many others won&amp;#39;t debate that fact but he didn&amp;#39;t send paid masked up goons with the authority of the President and more job security than a civil servant into minority neighborhoods to literally de-humanise and assault people in front of their kids as they send them to god knows where and call that shit righteous or justice. We still don&amp;#39;t know where the hundreds of missing people who got sent to &amp;quot;Alligator Alcatraz&amp;quot; went and nobody gives a shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the impact of this government&amp;#39;s god awful actions here at home, Vegas is dead, in 10 months tourism is gone these once bustling strips are empty, nobody wants to come here to the US let alone Vegas, nobody can afford to go out here or even wants to risk being caught up in this shitstorm here anymore. I work in finance I will tell you for free we are gonna be in a recession by the years end, no amount of tariff revenue can cover the gigantic holes in our economy being held up by the few US tech companies run by tech oligarchs right now profiting off the AI bubble before it bursts. Right now Nvidia has $4.6 trillion market cap, our entire pharmaceutical industry has a combined market cap of $4.2 trillion. If Nvidia has a bad day on the markets it now literally impacts the entire US economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to trade relations just give up Trump has alienated and threatened our own allies with his dumbass policy, yes start a trade war with China lets see how that will go for us when we haven&amp;#39;t had a robust manufacturing industry for the last 50 years because we outsource everything. It will just get to a point where the rest of the world will just turn their back on America because who would genuinely want work with us after all that has happened now? Just look at the Hyundai plant raid in Georgia that happened in September, 1 dumb woman named Tori Branum who mind you was running for Georgia&amp;#39;s 12th congressional district gave a tip to ICE about foreigners who were Korean nationals trying to train workers and get the Hyundai, 475 South Korean workers all here legally got detained by ICE. Now these guys got released eventually but all these workers all but 1 decided to leave and never return so we have a Hyundai Plant in Georgia that cost upwards of $7 billion to even build is now empty with no one to train AMERICAN workers for the job let alone actually work. South Korea is one of the largest foreign investors in the US and we have now given them no reason to trust us, same with China, India and others. We are risking cooperation and actual growth over the same culture wars that the Right criticizes constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have bigger shit to worry about we might heading into a fucking war with what seems to me South America and any other country our Commander in Queef and Weekend Warrior Pete decide to extrajudicially kill the citizens of with no evidence.
