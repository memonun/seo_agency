Recommended hybrid architecture 
Combine frameworks and automation for optimal results:
n8n handles data orchestration: Scheduled collection from SEO tools, YouTube API, social media
platforms, Twitter API, and news feeds. Preprocessing, deduplication, and enrichment before
storage.
Supabase provides data foundation: PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage, real-time
subscriptions for updates, Row Level Security for multi-tenant architectures, and Edge Functions as
API gateway.
CrewAI orchestrates intelligent layer: Multi-agent system with specialized roles accessing
appropriate data modules. Natural role-based architecture for marketing: Research Agent →
Strategy Agent → Content Creator → Performance Analyst.
Multi-LLM via OpenRouter: Switch between OpenAI (speed), Claude (quality), and open-source
models (cost) based on task requirements. Prevents vendor lock-in and optimizes costs through
intelligent routing.
