# Quick Start Guide

## For Your Terminal

You mentioned having issues running scripts. The problem was likely missing Playwright browsers, which is now fixed.

### Step 1: Verify Environment ✅

```bash
cd /Users/kuzey/seo_agency/social_scrapers
python test_environment.py
```

Expected output: All tests should pass ✅

### Step 2: What Works Now

#### ✅ Instagram Profile Scraping (WORKS)

```bash
# Test mode (5 posts)
python instagram/instagram_standalone.py \
  --input "https://www.instagram.com/nasa/" \
  --test

# Full scrape (50 posts)
python instagram/instagram_standalone.py \
  --input "https://www.instagram.com/nasa/" \
  --max-posts 50

# Check output
ls -lh outputs/instagram/
```

#### ❌ Instagram Hashtag Scraping (BROKEN)

```bash
# This will run but return 0 posts
python instagram/instagram_standalone.py \
  --input "travel" \
  --max-posts 50
```

**Why?** Apify changed their API - hashtag scraping no longer works

#### ❌ TikTok Scraping (BROKEN)

```bash
# This will run but return 0 videos
python tiktok/tiktok_standalone.py \
  --input "cat" \
  --max-videos 20
```

**Why?** TikTok detects the bot and blocks it

## Your Original Request

You wanted to scrape these hashtags:
- Instagram: $MIRX, #Miraclechain, #Airdrop, #Testnet, #NextGenerationChain, #NFT, #Blockchain
- TikTok: Same keywords

**Current Status**:
- ❌ Instagram hashtags: Not possible with current Apify API
- ❌ TikTok queries: Blocked by bot detection

**What You CAN Do**:
1. Find Instagram profiles posting about these topics
2. Scrape those profiles (this works!)
3. For TikTok: Use Apify's TikTok scraper (paid service)

---

## If You See Errors

### "playwright executable doesn't exist"
```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "TIKTOK_COOKIE not found"
Check your `.env` file exists and has the required variables

---

## Next Steps

### Option A: Use What Works
Scrape Instagram profiles instead of hashtags:
```bash
# Example: Find profiles related to crypto/blockchain
python instagram/instagram_standalone.py \
  --input "https://www.instagram.com/blockchain/" \
  --max-posts 100
```

### Option B: Implement Apify TikTok Scraper
I can help you add Apify's TikTok scraper (similar to Instagram approach).
This will work but costs money ($1-3 per 1000 videos).

### Option C: Find Alternative Services
Research other Instagram/TikTok API providers that support hashtag search.

2. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed setup and troubleshooting
3. **test_environment.py** - Run this to verify everything works

## Summary

✅ **Your environment is 100% working** - I ran `python test_environment.py` and all tests passed

✅ **Instagram profile scraping works** - You can scrape any profile

❌ **Instagram hashtag scraping is broken** - This is an Apify limitation, not your setup

❌ **TikTok scraping is blocked** - This is TikTok's bot detection, not your setup

**The scrapers run without errors, they just return 0 results because of external limitations (API changes and bot detection).**
